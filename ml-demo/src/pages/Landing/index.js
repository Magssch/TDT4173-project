                <p>For our final project in TDT4173 Machine Learning at NTNU, we have attempted to answer this question using different machine learning methods. 
                We did not find a definitive answer in the end, although by using 45k previously asked questions on stackoverflow.com, we have trained a model that might shed some 
                light on the characteristics of a high quality question, and that of a low quality and unfocused question.</p>
                <p>In the header you can find links to a general demonstration of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, as well as a live demonstration of question quality prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory.
                The demonstration of predicting question quality is created by hosting the trained model on Google Cloud AI Platform, and sending requests to the model through Firebase Functions.
                    The k-Nearest Neighbors-demonstration is created using d3 to manipulate an SVG-canvas. <br/></p>
